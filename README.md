# Conway's game of life

This project is really basic as it is not meant to be feature-complete.

I wanted a simple implementation of it to then be able to extend it to LENIA.

# How to run

Officially only linux is supported, but if you download raylib's dll and edit run.sh file it should work as expected on windows.

So, to run, you basically execute `run.sh` file (it also works with [just](https://github.com/casey/just) with `just run`)
